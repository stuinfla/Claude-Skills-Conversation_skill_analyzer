# Changelog

## [3.0.0] - October 2025

### 🚀 MAJOR: Optimized Data Fetching Strategy

This major version introduces a streamlined, efficient conversation fetching approach that improves reliability and speed.

### Changed

#### Optimized Fetching Strategy
- **Fixed target: 160 conversations** (was variable 150-250)
- **Efficient calls: 40 per call** using `n=40` parameter
- **Minimum 4 calls** to reach 160 conversations (40 × 4 = 160)
- **Progress visibility**: Shows "Fetching... 40... 80... 120... 160..."
- **Consistent results**: Fixed target ensures predictable analysis quality

#### Why This Change

**Before v3.0 (variable approach):**
- Fetched 150-250 conversations (inconsistent range)
- Unclear how many calls would be needed
- Variable analysis quality

**After v3.0 (fixed approach):**
- Always targets 160 conversations (or all available if fewer)
- Exactly 4 calls minimum for consistency
- Predictable, reliable pattern detection
- Clear progress tracking for users

#### Benefits
- **Better pattern detection**: 160 conversations provides excellent reliability
- **Faster processing**: Fixed target optimizes performance
- **Clear expectations**: Users know exactly what to expect
- **Progress transparency**: Live updates during fetching

### Technical Details

**Fetching Logic:**
```
Call 1: recent_chats(n=40) → 40 conversations
Call 2: recent_chats(n=40, before=<last_timestamp>) → 80 total
Call 3: recent_chats(n=40, before=<last_timestamp>) → 120 total
Call 4: recent_chats(n=40, before=<last_timestamp>) → 160 total
```

**Smart Handling:**
- If user has < 160 total: Fetch ALL available conversations
- If user has ≥ 160: Fetch exactly 160 most recent
- Pagination via `before` parameter with oldest conversation timestamp

### Migration from v2.7

No breaking changes. Upgrade seamlessly:
1. Replace skill files with v3.0
2. No configuration changes needed
3. Immediate benefit from optimized fetching

## [2.7.0] - October 2025

### 🚀 CRITICAL: Build Buttons Now Functional

The "Build This Skill" buttons now actually build the skills! This was the missing piece.

### Added

#### Skill Building Integration
- **"Build skill #1" command**: User can now request to build any recommended skill
- **Automatic skill-creator integration**: Claude extracts context and calls skill-creator
- **Pre-populated context**: Passes skill name, description, domain, requirements to skill-creator
- **Phase 5 workflow**: New phase for actually building the recommended skills

#### Three Ways to Build
1. **Direct request**: Say "Build skill #1" or "Build the [Name] skill"
2. **Button click**: Click the "Build This Skill" button in dashboard
3. **Ready prompt**: Ask "How do I build this?" to get a complete prompt

#### Smart Context Passing
When building a skill, Claude provides:
- Skill name and description
- User's domain (discovered from analysis)
- Evidence from conversations
- Expected impact and time savings
- Specific requirements from conversation patterns

### Changed

- **Quick Start**: Added step 7 about building skills
- **Phases**: Now 5 phases instead of 4 (added Building phase)
- **Dashboard instructions**: Buttons now have functional behavior specified
- **Implementation support**: Added comprehensive building instructions

### Why This Matters

**Before v2.7:** 
- Dashboard showed recommendations
- Buttons were just visual
- User had to manually figure out how to build

**After v2.7:**
- Dashboard is launchpad for building
- Buttons trigger actual skill creation
- One-click from recommendation to building

This completes the workflow: Analyze → Recommend → **BUILD**

---

## [2.6.0] - October 2025

### ⚠️ Critical Fix: Fetch Sufficient Data

Fixed the conversation fetching logic to actually gather enough data for meaningful analysis.

### Fixed

#### Conversation Fetching
- **Problem**: Was stopping at ~60 conversations even for Power users
- **Fixed**: Now fetches 150-250+ conversations for Active/Power users
- **Sweet spot**: 150-250 conversations provides best pattern detection
- **Updated logic**: More aggressive recommendations based on usage level

#### Smart Scope Recommendations (Updated)
- **< 50 chats**: Analyze everything
- **50-200 chats**: Analyze everything (need comprehensive view)
- **200-500 chats**: Fetch 150-200 minimum (last 3-6 months)
- **500-1000 chats**: Fetch 200-300 (last 3-6 months)
- **1000+ chats**: Fetch 250-350 (cap at 350 for performance)

#### Documentation Updates
- Added prominent warning: "Don't stop at 60 for Active/Power users"
- Explained why more data is better (pattern reliability, evidence, reduces false positives)
- Updated Phase 1 instructions with explicit counting requirements
- Emphasized sweet spot of 150-250 conversations

### Why This Matters

**Before v2.6:** Might only fetch 60-80 conversations, not enough for reliable patterns  
**After v2.6:** Fetches 150-250+ conversations, providing solid evidence for recommendations

More data = better pattern detection = more reliable skill recommendations.

## [2.5.0] - October 2025

### 🌟 Truly User-Adaptive Analysis

This critical update removes all hardcoded assumptions and makes the skill completely personalized to whoever runs it.

### Changed

#### No More Assumptions
- **Removed**: Any assumptions about user being AI consultant, developer, or specific profession
- **Added**: Explicit instructions to discover user's domain from conversations
- **Added**: User memory/preference checking before analysis
- **Changed**: Pattern detection discovers THEIR unique workflows, not predefined categories

#### User-Adaptive Discovery
- Discovers work domain from conversation topics (doesn't assume)
- Detects unique workflows specific to them
- Identifies their expertise from actual content
- Personalizes all recommendations to their work

#### Documentation Updates
- Diverse examples: developer, marketer, researcher, sales professional
- Explicit guidance: "Never assume profession or domain"
- User-focused language throughout
- Clear: "Your results will be completely different"

#### Critical Instructions Added
- Check user memory/preferences for context
- Infer profession/domain from conversation patterns
- Detect unique workflows and pain points
- Never assume specific role or industry
- Let conversations reveal what they do

### Why This Matters

Teachers, doctors, lawyers, marketers, researchers - anyone can use this now and get recommendations tailored to THEIR actual work, not generic or consultant-focused suggestions.

## [2.4.0] - October 2025

### 🎯 Simplified Dashboard - Action-Focused Design

This update simplifies the dashboard based on user feedback, removing complexity and emphasizing actionability.

### Changed

#### Single-Page Dashboard (removed tabs)
- **One scrollable page**: No more tabs - everything visible at once
- **Header with summary stats**: Quick overview cards at top
- **Top 5 skills in list**: Clean card layout, easy to scan
- **Prominent build buttons**: Each skill has "Build This Skill →" button
- **Less ROI detail**: Simplified metrics, removed overwhelming comparisons
- **Mobile-friendly**: Single scroll, no navigation required

#### Simplified Metrics
- **Removed**: Separate ROI dashboard tab, action plan tab, pattern analysis tab, usage timeline tab
- **Kept**: Essential metrics per skill (time saved, annual value, build time, break-even)
- **Added**: Summary stats cards at top showing totals
- **Focus**: Quick understanding, fast decision, immediate action

#### Design Improvements
- Cleaner card layouts with better spacing
- Bigger, more prominent action buttons
- Less visual clutter
- Faster to understand at a glance
- Professional but not over-designed

### Why These Changes

User feedback indicated:
- Too many tabs created navigation friction
- ROI details were overwhelming
- Users wanted quicker path to action
- Dashboard felt like analysis tool, not action tool
- Build buttons were buried in tabs

New design:
- Everything on one page - no hunting through tabs
- Build buttons prominent on every skill
- Summary stats show big picture instantly
- Individual skills show just enough detail to decide
- Clear, action-oriented layout
